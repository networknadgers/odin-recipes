Self reflection: 
Currently working on the Odin Project and practicing pushing and committing to Github 
Already know a fat stack of knowledge and im practicing it everyday
Learned  a ton  of stuff from the CLI and learned the basics of Github and git command 
Skills demonstrated are just like knowing how to push and pull and fork and modify and stage and add and commit and all that jazz
